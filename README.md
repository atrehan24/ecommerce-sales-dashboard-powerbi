# ðŸ›’ Madhav Ecommerce Sales Dashboard
Welcome! This repository contains a Power BI dashboard I created to analyze and visualize sales data for a fictional e-commerce business. The dashboard is built to offer insights into customer behavior, product performance, payment trends, and sales growth over time.
##  About the Project
This Power BI project focuses on making raw sales data meaningful and actionable. It presents key metrics such as:

- Total Sales Amount
- Profit Earned
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Quantity Sold

With this dashboard, you can easily answer questions like:
- Which states bring in the most revenue?
- What are the top-selling categories?
- Who are the best customers?
- How does profit vary month by month?


##  Features

- **Interactive Visuals** â€“ Filter by quarters and months to drill down into specific time periods.
- **Regional Analysis** â€“ Understand performance across major Indian states.
- **Customer Insights** â€“ View total amount spent by each customer.
- **Payment Preferences** â€“ Breakdown of purchases by payment mode.
- **Time Series Trends** â€“ Track profit month-wise to spot peaks and dips.
- **Product Category Performance** â€“ Visualize quantity sold by main and sub-categories.
